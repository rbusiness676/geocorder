In this module , We are trying to fetch location details like langitude, latitude etc using "text based input adrress".

For example

input :
======
address: "Bengaluru"

Output:
======
address: "Bnegaluru"
langitude: 13.7322386
latitude:  34.3843839

In order test this API, User must generate "Google API key" using below link:

https://cloud.google.com/console/google/maps-apis/overview

We are exposing two apis for two different approaches to acheive the same functionality.

1) http://127.0.0.1:8000/location/
2) http://127.0.0.1:8000/find/

Above urls take, thress input parameters,
========================================

google_key [ mandatory] - refers google api key
file_out   [Optional, auto created, return in response] - refers to response generated
file_in    [Optional, defaulted to local file "test.xlsx"] - refers to input address data


NOTE:
=====
    FACING SOME ISSUES WITH GOOGLE API KEY, THIS CODE MAY REQUIRED SOME CHANGES.
